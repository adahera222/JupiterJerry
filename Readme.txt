Dear internet person,

This project is a game I've been developing in Unity3D. 

This is a learning project. 
The code is messy and seldom commented because, until this point, it was for my eyes only.
As I draw this project to it's v1.0, I'll be progressively cleaning things up and commenting on code so others can make some sense of it.

Feel free to check it out. At the moment you'll need Unity3D to load the project and make a build. I've been optimizing it to use 960x600 px resolution for the web player.

If you have questions or comments, you can contact me at ilikepopsoda@gmail.com.

Good day, fine sir/madaam.
Gerald Kelley
